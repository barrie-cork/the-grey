## Integration Architecture

### Data Collection Pipeline
```
review_manager (session data) 
    ↓
search_strategy (methodology)
    ↓  
serp_execution (search results)
    ↓
results_manager (processing stats)
    ↓
review_results (decisions)
    ↓
reporting (aggregated reports)
```

### Report Generation Flow
1. **Data Aggregation**: Collect data from all workflow stages
2. **Validation**: Ensure data completeness and consistency
3. **Template Processing**: Apply formatting and structure
4. **Export Generation**: Create final reports in requested formats
