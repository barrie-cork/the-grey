# Denormalized Session Fields Fix

## Issue
After creating fresh migrations, the search strategy form was failing with:
```
IntegrityError: null value in column "session_id" of relation "search_queries" violates not-null constraint
```

## Root Cause
The SearchQuery model has a denormalized `session` field for performance optimization. While there are Django signals in `apps/core/signals.py` that should automatically populate this field, they may not always trigger reliably, especially during bulk operations or when objects are created before all apps are fully loaded.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated SearchStrategyView._update_search_queries()
File: `/apps/search_strategy/views.py` (line 334)
```python
SearchQuery.objects.create(
    strategy=strategy,
    session=strategy.session,  # Add the denormalized session reference
    query_text=query_data["query"],
    query_type=query_data["type"],
    target_domain=query_data.get("domain"),
    execution_order=i + 1,
)
```

### 2. Fixed Signal Errors
File: `/apps/core/signals.py`
- Removed `update_searchexecution_session` signal (SearchExecution no longer has session field)
- Updated `sync_searchquery_dependents` to only update RawSearchResult objects
- SearchExecution model was refactored to remove the denormalized session field

## Pattern to Follow
When creating objects that have denormalized session fields, always explicitly set the session field rather than relying solely on signals:

### Models with denormalized session fields:
- `SearchQuery` - has `session` field denormalized from `strategy.session`
- `RawSearchResult` - has `session` field denormalized from `execution.query.strategy.session`
- `SimpleReviewDecision` - has `session` field denormalized from `result.session`

**Note**: `SearchExecution` no longer has a denormalized `session` field after the refactoring

### Best Practice
Always include the session field when creating these objects:
```python
# Good
SearchQuery.objects.create(
    strategy=strategy,
    session=strategy.session,  # Explicit
    ...
)

# Risky - relies on signals
SearchQuery.objects.create(
    strategy=strategy,
    # session field omitted - signal may not fire
    ...
)
```

## Verification
After applying the fix:
1. Restarted web and celery_worker services
2. The search strategy form should now save without integrity errors
3. Test by creating/updating search strategies through the UI

## Notes
- The signals in `apps/core/signals.py` remain as a safety net
- Test files already follow this pattern of explicit session assignment
- This approach ensures data integrity even if signals fail to fire
