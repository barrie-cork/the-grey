   - [x] ResultMetadata for extra fields

5. **review_results**
   - [x] ReviewTag for categorization
   - [x] ReviewDecision for include/exclude
   - [x] ReviewTagAssignment for tagging
   - [x] ReviewComment for collaboration

6. **reporting**
   - [x] ExportReport for PRISMA exports

#### Database
- [x] All migrations created and applied

- [x] Foreign key relationships established

### âœ… Phase 3: Authentication (COMPLETED)

- [x] Custom User model with UUID primary key
- [x] User registration with email validation
- [x] Login (username or email)
- [x] Profile management
- [x] Password reset flow
- [x] Django admin integration
- [x] Responsive templates with Bootstrap 5
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage

### ðŸŸ¡ Phase 4: Core Features (IN PROGRESS)

#### Admin Configuration
- [x] Basic admin for all models
- [ ] Advanced admin features (filters, actions)
- [ ] Inline editing for related models

#### Views and Templates
- [ ] Search session dashboard
- [ ] Session creation wizard
- [ ] Search query builder (PIC framework)
- [ ] Results review interface
- [ ] PRISMA report generation

#### API Development
- [ ] DRF ViewSets for all models
- [ ] API authentication (JWT)
- [ ] Pydantic schemas for validation
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI)

### ðŸ“… Phase 5: Integration (PLANNED)

- [ ] Serper API integration
- [ ] Celery tasks for search execution
- [ ] Result processing pipeline
- [ ] Duplicate detection algorithm
- [ ] Export functionality

### ðŸ“… Phase 6: Polish (PLANNED)

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Comprehensive logging
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Deployment scripts

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality
- âœ… Type hints added to all models
- âœ… Consistent code structure
- âœ… Django best practices followed
- âœ… Vertical slice architecture maintained

### Testing
- âœ… Test structure established
- âœ… Auth tests comprehensive
- ðŸŸ¡ Model tests needed for other apps
- ðŸ“… Integration tests planned

### Documentation
- âœ… PRDs for all major features
- âœ… Implementation task lists
- âœ… Code comments and docstrings
- ðŸŸ¡ API documentation pending

## Current Focus

Working on Phase 4: Core Features
- Next: Implement search session dashboard view
- Then: Create session wizard with PIC framework
- Then: Build search execution pipeline

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Access points
http://localhost:8000/       # Main application
http://localhost:8000/admin/ # Django admin
http://localhost:5555/       # Flower (Celery monitoring)

# Test credentials
Username: testadmin
Password: admin123
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py test

# Create migrations
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser

# Shell access
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py shell
```

## Architecture Decisions

1. **UUID Primary Keys**: Better for distributed systems
2. **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Each app is self-contained
3. **Docker First**: All development through containers
4. **Type Safety**: Type hints and Pydantic schemas
5. **Test Driven**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **SOLID Principles**: Clean, maintainable code

## Known Issues

1. Docker Compose shows version warning (cosmetic)
2. Local development requires Docker running
3. Email only works in console mode (development)

## Team Notes

- Authentication is production-ready
- Models are well-structured with proper relationships
- Admin interface is functional for all models
- Ready to start building user-facing views
