# Code Review #2

## Summary
This refactor significantly simplifies the results_manager app by removing complex relevance scoring and quality indicators in favor of basic, practical metadata. The changes reduce cognitive overhead while maintaining essential functionality.

## Issues Found

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix)
- **Missing Migration**: apps/results_manager/models.py - The model changes (removed `has_full_text`, `quality_indicators`, added `has_full_text` property) require a migration file to be generated and applied.
- **Broken References**: apps/review_results/services/review_recommendation_service.py:50+ - Still references old `extra()` query with removed fields like `relevance_score` and `has_full_text` 
- **Import Error**: apps/results_manager/tasks.py:19 - Imports non-existent `calculate_relevance_score` function that was removed
- **Undefined Variable**: apps/results_manager/models.py:91 - References `has_full_text` in quality assessment but field was removed

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Fix)
- **Deprecated Method**: apps/results_manager/services/quality_assessment_service.py:15-39 - `calculate_relevance_score()` is marked deprecated but still being called elsewhere
- **Inconsistent Naming**: apps/results_manager/services/processing_analytics_service.py:78 - Method renamed from `prioritize_results_for_review` to `get_results_for_review` but callers not updated
- **Missing Type Hints**: Multiple service methods lack proper type hints (e.g., `assess_document_quality` parameter types)
- **Hardcoded Values**: apps/results_manager/templatetags/results_tags.py - Uses hardcoded year 2024 instead of dynamic current year

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor (Consider)
- **Empty Comments**: apps/results_manager/models.py:91 - Has trailing comment "# Content indicators" with no content
- **Unused Imports**: Several files may have unused imports after refactoring (warnings module in quality_assessment_service.py)
- **Documentation**: Method docstrings not updated to reflect simplified approach (still mention relevance scores)

## Good Practices
- Consistent removal of complex scoring logic across multiple files
- Simplified data model focusing on essential metadata
- Improved query performance by removing JSON field operations
- Clear deprecation warnings added for backwards compatibility
- Maintained existing API contracts where possible

## Test Coverage
Current: Unknown | Required: 90%
Missing tests:
- Model changes need updated test cases
- Service method signature changes need test updates
- Template tag simplifications need test coverage
- Migration tests for data integrity
