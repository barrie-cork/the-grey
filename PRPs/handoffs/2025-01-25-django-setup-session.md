# Django Setup Session Handoff - 2025-01-25

## Session Overview
This session implemented the PRP system for Thesis Grey and completed Phase 1 of Django environment setup using Docker, following the PRD specifications for a Django 4.2 grey literature management application.

## Project Context

### What is Thesis Grey?
A Django 4.2 web application designed to help researchers systematically find, manage, and review grey literature (research outside traditional academic databases). It follows PRISMA guidelines and automates search execution through Google Search API via Serper.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Framework**: Django 4.2.11 (LTS until April 2026)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with Psycopg 3
- **Cache/Broker**: Redis 7
- **Task Queue**: Celery 5.3.6
- **Container**: Docker with docker-compose
- **Development**: WSL2 environment
- **Architecture Pattern**: Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA)

## Current Project State

### Location
```
/mnt/d/Python/Projects/django/HTA-projects/agent-grey/
```

### What's Been Completed
1. **PRP System Integration** ✅
   - Copied Claude commands to `.claude/commands/`
   - Set up PRP templates and scripts
   - Enhanced CLAUDE.md with PRP guidelines
   - Created example PRPs

2. **Docker Environment** ✅
   - Created `.docker/django/Dockerfile`
   - Created `.docker/nginx/default.conf`
   - Created `docker-compose.yml` with 7 services:
     - web (Django)
     - db (PostgreSQL 15)
     - redis (Redis 7)
     - celery_worker
     - celery_beat
     - flower (monitoring)
     - nginx (reverse proxy)
   - Created `.env.example` and `.env`
   - Created requirements structure (base/local/production)

### What's NOT Done Yet
- Django project not initialized
- Custom User model not created (CRITICAL!)
- No Django apps created
- Database not running
- No migrations exist

## Critical Next Steps (IN THIS ORDER!)

### 1. Build Docker Environment
```bash
cd /mnt/d/Python/Projects/django/HTA-projects/agent-grey/
docker-compose build
```

### 2. Initialize Django Project (Inside Docker)
```bash
docker-compose run --rm web django-admin startproject grey_lit_project .
```

### 3. Create Custom User Model (BEFORE ANY MIGRATIONS!)
```bash
# Create accounts app first
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py startapp accounts apps/accounts

# Then immediately create User model with UUID primary key
# Update settings.py with AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.User'
# ONLY THEN run migrations
```

## Key Technical Insights

### From Research
1. **Django 4.2 + Docker Best Practices (2024)**
   - Use Docker Compose for all services
   - Health checks prevent race conditions
   - Store code in WSL2 filesystem for performance
   - Use .env files for configuration

2. **Custom User Model Requirements**
   - MUST be created before first migration
   - Use UUID as primary key
   - Inherit from AbstractUser
   - Set AUTH_USER_MODEL in settings

3. **VSA Implementation**
   - Each Django app is a complete feature
   - Contains models, views, forms, templates, tests
   - High cohesion within app, loose coupling between apps
   - Aligns with Django's app philosophy

4. **Settings Structure**
   - Split into base/local/production
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Never commit .env files
   - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE controls which to use

### Project-Specific Requirements
1. **7 Django Apps** (from PRD):
   - accounts (custom User with UUID)
   - review_manager (9-state workflow)
   - search_strategy (PIC framework)
   - serp_execution (Serper API integration)
   - results_manager (processing pipeline)
   - review_results (tagging interface)
   - reporting (PRISMA compliance)

2. **Database Design**:
   - All models use UUID primary keys
   - SearchSession is core model
   - 9-state workflow with validation
   - Audit trails on all changes

3. **Technology Stack**:
   - Celery for ALL external API calls
   - Batch processing (50 results/batch)
   - Redis for caching and message broker
   - PostgreSQL with proper indexes

## Commands for Quick Resume

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /mnt/d/Python/Projects/django/HTA-projects/agent-grey/

# 2. Check Docker services
docker-compose ps

# 3. If not built yet
docker-compose build

# 4. Initialize Django (if manage.py doesn't exist)
docker-compose run --rm web django-admin startproject grey_lit_project .

# 5. Create apps directory (if not exists)
docker-compose run --rm web mkdir -p apps
docker-compose run --rm web touch apps/__init__.py

# 6. CRITICAL: Create accounts app and User model FIRST
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py startapp accounts apps/accounts
# Then add UUID User model before ANY migrations
```

## Environment Status

### Files Created
- ✅ Docker configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- ✅ Environment files (.env, .env.example)
- ✅ Requirements (base.txt, local.txt, production.txt)
- ✅ Ignore files (.dockerignore, .gitignore)
- ✅ PRP system integrated
- ✅ CLAUDE.md enhanced

### Services Configured
- ✅ PostgreSQL 15 with health checks
- ✅ Redis 7 with persistence
- ✅ Celery worker and beat
- ✅ Flower monitoring
- ✅ Nginx reverse proxy

### Not Yet Running
- ❌ No containers built or running
- ❌ No Django project files
- ❌ No database tables
- ❌ No Django apps

## Validation Checkpoints

Before proceeding, verify:
1. Docker Desktop is running (if on Windows/Mac)
2. WSL2 is active (if on Windows)
3. You're in the correct directory
4. .env file exists with proper values
5. No existing manage.py file (for fresh start)

## PRP Status

### Active PRPs
- `PRPs/django-environment-setup.md` - Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 pending

### Example PRPs Created
- `PRPs/example-serp-api-integration.md` - For future reference

### Next PRP to Create
Consider creating:
- `PRPs/custom-user-model-setup.md` - For UUID User implementation
- `PRPs/django-apps-creation.md` - For creating all 7 apps

## Final Notes

1. **CRITICAL**: The Custom User model MUST be created before running any migrations. This cannot be changed later without significant database work.

2. **Docker First**: All Django commands should be run through docker-compose, not locally.

3. **Settings Module**: Will need to configure DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE for the split settings structure.

4. **Next Session**: Start with building Docker containers and creating Django project structure.
