# Agent B5: User Research - Innovation-First Approach

## Research Focus
Analysis of advanced users and innovation adoption patterns for an innovation-first Review Results app targeting power users, early adopters, and technology-forward researchers who seek cutting-edge functionality to transform their systematic review workflows.

## Key Findings

**Innovation-Hungry Research Community**: Academic researchers, particularly in digital health, computational sciences, and interdisciplinary fields, show strong appetite for AI-powered tools that amplify their analytical capabilities rather than just automating existing processes.

**Early Adopter Characteristics**: Power users in systematic review contexts are typically senior researchers, methodological experts, and digital-native academic professionals who value efficiency gains and are willing to invest learning time for transformative capabilities.

**Sophistication Gradient**: Advanced users operate across a spectrum from "enhanced traditional" (wanting better versions of familiar tools) to "transformation seeking" (embracing entirely new paradigms for research).

**Collaborative Intelligence Demand**: Multi-PI research teams and international collaborations increasingly seek platforms that enable real-time collaborative decision-making with built-in quality assurance and consensus mechanisms.

**AI Partnership Mindset**: Leading researchers view AI not as replacement but as research partner, seeking tools that augment human expertise while maintaining scientific rigor and transparent decision-making.
