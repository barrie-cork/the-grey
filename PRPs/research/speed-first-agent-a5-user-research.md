# Agent A5: User Research - Speed-First Approach

## Research Focus

This research analyzes user needs and behavior patterns for academic researchers conducting systematic literature reviews, specifically focusing on the critical Review Results phase. The speed-first approach prioritizes rapid deployment of core functionality to enable immediate user feedback and iterative improvement, particularly targeting the manual review, tagging, and annotation workflow that represents the most time-intensive phase of grey literature reviews.

## Key Findings

### User Persona Analysis

**Primary Persona: Academic Clinical Researcher**
- **Profile**: PhD-level researchers developing clinical guidelines, conducting systematic reviews for healthcare policy
- **Technical Comfort**: Moderate to high digital literacy, familiar with reference management tools (Zotero, Mendeley)
- **Time Constraints**: Extremely limited - often reviewing 500-2000 search results under tight deadline pressure
- **Quality Standards**: Must maintain PRISMA compliance and detailed audit trails for publication requirements
- **Current Pain Points**: Manual result screening in spreadsheets, losing track of exclusion rationales, difficulty maintaining consistency across large result sets

**Secondary Persona: Guideline Development Team Member**
- **Profile**: Masters-level research assistants supporting senior researchers
- **Technical Comfort**: High digital nativity, comfortable with web applications and collaboration tools
- **Workflow Focus**: Processing large volumes of results efficiently while maintaining quality standards
- **Key Need**: Clear guidance systems and error prevention to ensure consistency with senior researcher expectations

### Critical Workflow Analysis

**Literature Review Screening Process (Current State)**:
1. Export search results to Excel/CSV (15-30 minutes setup time)
2. Manual title/abstract screening (2-5 minutes per result)
3. Tag results as Include/Exclude/Maybe with reasons (additional 1-2 minutes for exclusions)
4. Track progress manually (constant context switching)
5. Consolidate decisions for team review (30-60 minutes per session)

**Speed-First Target Workflow**:
1. One-click access to processed results (< 5 seconds)
2. Rapid tagging interface with keyboard shortcuts (< 30 seconds per result)
3. Quick exclusion reason capture (< 15 seconds additional)
4. Automatic progress tracking (real-time)
5. Immediate team visibility (no consolidation needed)

### User Behavior Patterns

**Decision Making Process**:
- **Title Scan**: 5-10 seconds for initial relevance assessment
- **Abstract Review**: 30-90 seconds for detailed evaluation
- **Decision Point**: Include (quick), Maybe (hesitation pattern), Exclude (requires justification)
- **Batch Behavior**: Users prefer to review 20-25 results before taking breaks
- **Context Switching**: High cost when moving between tools (3-5 minute re-engagement time)

**Quality Assurance Behaviors**:
- Regular "sanity checks" by reviewing previously tagged results
- Frequent consultation with inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Cross-referencing with team members for edge cases
- Detailed note-taking for borderline decisions

## Critical Insights

### Insight 1: Speed vs. Quality Tension
Users need to process results quickly but cannot compromise on decision quality. The interface must provide rapid interaction patterns while including sufficient context and safeguards to maintain research integrity.

### Insight 2: Cognitive Load Management
Systematic review requires sustained attention over hours. The interface must minimize cognitive overhead through clear visual hierarchies, consistent interaction patterns, and progress feedback that maintains motivation.

### Insight 3: Audit Trail Anxiety
Researchers are highly concerned about losing work or having incomplete documentation. Auto-save functionality and visible confirmation of saved decisions are critical for user confidence.

### Insight 4: Collaborative Context
Even in single-user Phase 1, users think in terms of team workflows. Design decisions should anticipate future collaboration features without over-engineering the MVP.

### Insight 5: Integration Expectations
Users expect seamless transitions between search strategy definition, result processing, and review phases. The Review Results interface must clearly connect to the broader workflow context.
