# Signal Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. FieldDoesNotExist: SearchExecution has no field named 'session'
After the major refactoring, the SearchExecution model no longer has a denormalized `session` field, but the signals were still trying to update it.

### 2. IntegrityError: null value in column "session_id" 
SearchQuery objects were being created without the required denormalized session field.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed core/signals.py
- **Removed** `update_searchexecution_session` signal - SearchExecution doesn't have session field
- **Updated** `sync_searchquery_dependents` to only update RawSearchResult objects (removed SearchExecution update)

### 2. Updated search_strategy/views.py
- Added explicit `session=strategy.session` when creating SearchQuery objects

### 3. Reverted tasks.py
- Removed `session=session` from SearchExecution.objects.create() since the field doesn't exist

## Current State of Denormalized Fields

After refactoring, these models have denormalized session fields:
- ✅ `SearchQuery` - has `session` field
- ✅ `RawSearchResult` - has `session` field  
- ✅ `SimpleReviewDecision` - has `session` field
- ❌ `SearchExecution` - NO session field (removed in refactoring)

## Signals Still Active

1. `update_rawsearchresult_session` - Auto-populates RawSearchResult.session
2. `update_searchquery_session` - Auto-populates SearchQuery.session
3. `update_reviewdecision_session` - Auto-populates SimpleReviewDecision.session
4. `sync_searchquery_dependents` - Updates RawSearchResult when SearchQuery.session changes
5. `sync_processedresult_dependents` - Updates SimpleReviewDecision when ProcessedResult.session changes

## Best Practice
Always explicitly set denormalized fields when creating objects, don't rely solely on signals.
