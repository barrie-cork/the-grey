## Overview

This document outlines the core functional and technical requirements for the Results Manager feature, stratified by development phase. These requirements are derived from the overall project requirements and are specific to processing and managing search results obtained from the SERP Execution module.

The Results Manager serves as the critical bridge between raw search engine results and the manual review process, implementing sophisticated processing, normalization, and deduplication algorithms to prepare high-quality result sets for researcher review.
